A binary tree is made up of a finite set of elements called nodes. This set either is empty or consists of a node called the root together with two binary trees, called the left and right subtrees, which are disjoint from each other and from the root. (Disjoint means that they have no nodes in common.) The roots of these subtrees are children of the root. There is an edge from a node to each of its children, and a node is said to be the parent of its children.



-------Learning Objectives---------
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

1. What is a binary tree
2. What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
3. What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
4. What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
5. What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
6. What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
